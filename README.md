# DiscordAiBot
 
Simple bot - Simple Py script that connects ollama API to Discord bot. This bot doesn't have any memory and only takes responses from API and send them to chat.

Advanced bot - Uses JSON for memory management. Uses AI to extract important information and save them to long-term memory. Chat history is saved for better responses. AI saves memory per user and works with entire memory when generating answare.

Default setting uses localhost for ollama.

Make sure to have all dependencies!

Run bot with pyton in terminal/cmd.
